- **Modular Template Extensions**: Allow custom template overrides per novel via additional directories. Benefit: Easier customization for multi-novel sites. Implementation: Enhance template loading in `generate.py` to check novel-specific folders.

- **Error Handling and Validation**: Add build-time validation for config/front matter (e.g., required fields, duplicate IDs). Benefit: Prevents broken builds. Implementation: YAML schema checks in `generate.py`.

- **Improved Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels to navigation, ensure keyboard-focusable elements, and enforce alt text for all images (with build-time warnings for missing ones). Benefit: Complies with WCAG standards, widening audience. Implementation: Update templates with ARIA attributes; add checks in `generate.py` for image alt text.
