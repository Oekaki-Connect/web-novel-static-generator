these todos are currently all related to the manga/comic features:
- the Manga Reader Settings modal should be aligned vertically in the viewport right now it's aligned to the top
- when on the first page of a manga chapter and the if the user tries to go to to the previous page it should go to the previous chapter, same with being on the final page it should try to go to the next chapter, in both cases the next page should have a ? variable added to the link so that when that chapter's page mode it restores the current mode (if in fullscreen for example) so that they can seamlessly continue reading (if not in full screen mode there should be a ? value which makes the page automatically fit the manga page to the viewport) the goal is to allow seamless reading (could include a non-obtrusive toast of the current chapter #/title at the top right so readers know they switches chapters)
