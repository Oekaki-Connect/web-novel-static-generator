these todos are currently all related to the manga/comic features:
- is it possible when changing pages to have the next pages prepared before switching to them? to try and avoid some of the jank when moving between pages (especially when in single / double view, since for an insant there is zero height as the next pages are loaded) please think about this problem and come up with a solution to improve the reader experience (since right now even with image preloading instead of immediately showing the next image when you go to the next image it's only the site's background you see for a tiny moement which is jarring)
- let's add another view mode: Vertical Scroll Double, in this mode show 2 pages at once, assume that the first page is a cover and should be shown on its own, but include a chapter config to change this behavior to say if the first page is a cover or not (if it's not a cover then 2 pages should be shown at once for the first 2 pages for both double modes)
- make sure that the watchdog for --serve and --watch is not watching the .git folder for file changes to make it rebuild the site
