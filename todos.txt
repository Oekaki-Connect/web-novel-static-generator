these todos are currently all related to the manga/comic features:
- let's add another view mode: Vertical Scroll Double, in this mode show 2 pages at once, assume that the first page is a cover and should be shown on its own, but include a chapter config to change this behavior to say if the first page is a cover or not (if it's not a cover then 2 pages should be shown at once for the first 2 pages for both double modes)
